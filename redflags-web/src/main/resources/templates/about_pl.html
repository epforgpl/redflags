[ TODO PL ] The <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#BC2A52">Red Flags</span> project aims
to enhance the transparency of public procurements in Hungary and
<strong>support the fight against corrupt procurements.</strong> It provides an
interactive tool that allows the monitoring of procurement processes and their
implementation by citizens, journalists or even public officials and catch fraud
risks at different stages of the procurement process.
The <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#BC2A52">Red Flags</span> tool
automatically checks procurement documents from the Tenders Electronic Daily
(TED) and <strong>filters risky procurements</strong> through a special
algorithm. Although risky does not mean corrupt, flagged procurement documents
are worth checking. Users can subscribe to receive alerts if risky procurements
are published (generally or in their special field of interest).
